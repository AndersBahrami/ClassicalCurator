The Classical Curator is an application which helps you find new (and often obscure) classical music. 
It uses the Open Opus API to access and search for classical music and composers. 
You can find and save music you like, and the Classical Curator will provide you with an unusually diverse array of classical music reccomendations.

Unfortunately, you cannot play any music using this application. However, I have done my best to create an app which allows the user to navigate the Open Opus dataset.

This is a project I completed in my senior year of highschool for a computer science class. Here is a demo video I whipped together last minute.
